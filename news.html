            <b>Southern Water has been fined a record £90m for deliberately dumping billions of litres of raw sewage
                into the sea.</b>
            <p>
                The company admitted 6,971 illegal spills from 17 sites in Hampshire, Kent and West Sussex between 2010
                and 2015.
                His Honour Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson said the offences had been "committed deliberately" by Southern
                Water's board of directors at the time.
                Lawyers for the company had told Canterbury Crown Court the spills were the result of "negligence".
                The offences were discovered as part of the Environment Agency's largest ever criminal investigation,
                which began after shellfish were found to be contaminated with E. coli.
                Raw sewage had been diverted away from treatment works and into the environment, allowing the company to
                avoid financial penalties and the costs of upkeep and upgrades, the court heard.
                Mr Justice Johnson said Southern Water "showed a shocking and wholesale disregard for the environment,
                for the precious and delicate ecosystems along the north Kent and Solent coastlines, to human health and
                to the fisheries and other legitimate businesses that depend on the vitality of the coastal waters".

                'Occurring events'
            </h2>
            <p>
                The total volume of untreated sewage dumped into the environment was estimated between 16 to 21 billion
                litres, or 7,400 Olympic-sized swimming pools, the court heard.
                In Bedhampton Creek, in Havant, Hampshire, anglers reported finding sanitary towels, condoms and tissues
                in the water, along with a strong smell of sewage, the court heard.
                Residents in Swalecliffe, Kent, said discharges from the sewage works were "occurring events", the court
                heard.

            <p>The "sheer scale" of offending meant it was "inherently unlikely this was due to a small number of rogue
                employees".
                "It is far more likely to be due to deliberate disregard for the law from the top down," the judge said.
                The offences had been aggravated by Southern Water's "persistent pollution of the environment" which had
                led to 168 previous convictions and cautions, he said.
                He said the scale of the fine was intended to "bring home to the management of this and other companies
                the need to comply with laws that are designed to protect the environment".
                It is the largest sentence issued by a court after an Environment Agency investigation, exceeding
                <strong>a £20m
                    fine received by Thames Water in 2017</strong></p>

                In March 2020, Southern Water admitted 51 counts at Maidstone Crown Court, covering discharges of
                untreated sewage from sites in:

            <p>During periods of heavy rain, water companies are permitted to divert untreated waste water away from
                treatment plants, discharging sewage straight into the environment to prevent sewers backing up.
                However, the Environment Agency found that on thousands of occasions untreated sewage had left Southern
                Water sites through this route during periods of lower rainfall.
                Directing sewage straight into rivers and seas improved the quality of treated water leaving the works,
                which is regularly tested and can lead to heavy fines if standards fall, the court heard.
                Mr Justice Johnson said the offences had been motivated by a desire to "focus the company's attention on
                those metrics that increase its income, disregarding its wider compliance obligations".
                Chief executive Ian McAulay, who was appointed in 2017, was in court on Friday alongside chairman Keith
                Lough, who joined in 2019.
                After the hearing, Mr McAulay said: "We have heard what the judge has said today and will reflect
                closely on the sentence and his remarks.
                "He has rightly put the environment front and centre which is what matters to all of us. "
                Mr McAulay said the fine would not affect customers' bills or infrastructure investments, with
                shareholders due to bear the cost.
