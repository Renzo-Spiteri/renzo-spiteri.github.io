                    The most common type of <strong>sandwiches</strong> is a slice of bread 
                    or buns with some kind of snack stuffed in them (<i>cheese, ham, 
                    sausage, caviar, meat, fish, canned food</i>). They can be decorated 
                    with leafy and spicy vegetables, pieces of egg and lemon, 
                    olives, sauce, gherkin mayonnaise etc. The sandwiches 
                    are served on dishes, in vases with flat edges or on plates
                    covered with napkins. As they are not subject to long-term
                    storage, the sandwiches are cooked immediately before serving.

                            <strong>Hot sandwiches</strong> are getting warmed up during 
                            preparation and consumed, as a rule, hot. Their 
                            filling is usually covered with a slice of cheese, 
                            and the sandwich is heated until the cheese melts. 
                            You can also use various types of herbs to decorate
                            the sandwiches: <i>parsley, lettuce, dill etc.</i>
