      Webpage makeup is a creation of a hypertext document structure based on
      HTML markup with the use of stylesheets and client scripts so that design
      elements look similar to the layout.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML makeup differs from the printing one as it is necessary to take into
      account the difference of elements displayed depending on the browser and
      the devices" size difference.
    </p>

    <p>
      The process is complex and has a creative basis. None of the methods is
      considered to be canonical. All approaches have their own benefits and
      drawbacks.
